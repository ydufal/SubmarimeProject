# SubmarimeProject


This project was about the creation of one Simulator :

      - You will find two version ( First and final ) 
      
      - The final version is really more complete than the first one just have a look it.
      
      The project aimed at the realisation of an IOT environment simulator. The goal was to model an ecosystem of sensors to monitor the interior environment of a diving submarine. The ecosystem was based on four different types of sensors. These sensors were then to communicate with a server on which the transmitted data was displayed and/or stored.
